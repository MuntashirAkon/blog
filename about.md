My name is Muntashir Al-Islam (also known as Muntashir Akon<span class="sidenote-number"></span>).
I have a B.S in Computer Science & Engineering. I am an open source contributor and activist.
My activism particularly focuses on <a href="https://reproducible-builds.org/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">reproducible builds</a> and privacy.
My current job is really a side-job where I work remotely from home. I am available for hiring<span class="sidenote-number"></span> until I manage a better job.
[Unlike some people, I shall not disclose my hobbies because you'll think I'm joking.]
<span class="sidenote"><em>Akon</em> is my surname.</span>
