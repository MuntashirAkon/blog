1. Writing documentation for v4.0.0 is more complicated than I thought. So, I shall release a new beta with partial documentation as the time is running out for beta, and complete the documentation in the RC.
2. One of the reasons for me being slow in the development is that my Xiaomi phone does not work in the US due to bandwidth limitations. I have also moved to a place which is about 1,000 feet higher than where I used to live. As a result, the battery also does not last long. I also have a (cheap) iPhone which I now use regularly (which is unbearable, by the way). However, I have ordered a Pixel phone which, hopefully, will be delivered at the end of this week. Once I get my new phone, I can be more regular in the development as well.
3. Due to study and research pressure, I need to be more efficient with the development. So, I decided to discontinue alpha-beta testing from this release. From now on, only RC and stable releases will be provided. This also means that features will be a bit unstable and inconsistent for the stable users. What this means is that features as well as bug fixes will be delivered as soon as sufficient contributions are made. If there are new and exciting features, the minor section shall be increased (e.g., 4.0.x → 4.1.x), and if there are only minor features or fixes, the patch section shall be increased (e.g., 4.x.0 → 4.x.1). This also implies that there won’t be any major releases until I believe that I can handle alpha-beta testing again. This may be a bad news for some users, but this has to be done to prevent potential “burn-out” on my part.
