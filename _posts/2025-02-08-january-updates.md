- In the past couple of weeks, a lot of improvements have been made to the existing features, and I am happy to announce that v4.0.0 will be released in the next week. Writing changelog for 5 different platforms is not an easy task, but I'm almost finished writing the in-app changelog which is, by far, the most complicated one. Testers have also done a good job in reporting potential issues and fixes were made promptly.
- As App Manager is built on the principles of open source, privacy and security, and (according to the last poll) almost 60% of the users are using App Manager for privacy, I'll be focusing more on improving the most crucial projects that App Manager depend on in regards to privacy, such as [ADL](https://github.com/MuntashirAkon/android-debloat-list) and [Android Libraries](https://github.com/MuntashirAkon/android-libraries). Advanced users and community members are encouraged to contribute to the ADL project since all the related projects are now more-or-less dead. ADL project, compared to App Manager, is a very small project and does not require any coding or programming skills. You may need to have some knowledge about [JSON](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JSON#Syntax) which is very easy to learn. I'd ask every one of you to try to contribute at least once a month to the ADL project to accelerate the process of listing and reviewing the bloatware in Android. Once we can bring it to a stable position, the maintenance would be quite easy.
