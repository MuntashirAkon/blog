From the next month, I am going to start a new blog series where I'll be
reviewing various open source Android applications. This idea came to my mind
because a lot of readers here are using Android devices and I am already
reviewing a lot of applications as part of my new project, [Android Debloat
List](https://github.com/MuntashirAkon/android-debloat-list). The applications
do not necessarily have to be free and open source (FOSS), but the open source
is a requirement for now.

## Aspects I'll be covering

I generally review an application in many different aspects. For example:
1. Initial impression of the project. This involves terms of service (TOS),
   End user license agreement (EULA), software and source code licenses,
   contributors license agreement (CLA), transparency of decision making and
   funding, documentations, identity of the maintainers, etc.
2. Initial impression of the software. This involves default user interface,
   libraries and framework used, expected size versus actual size of the APK
   files, and so on.
3. User experience. This includes verbosity of features, design choices (use of
   buttons, bottom sheets, etc.), common software engineering problems, bugs,
   etc. This will be full of personal opinions, of course. But this blog is my
   personal blog anyway.
4. Privacy and security aspect. Network activities, use of trackers, vulnerable
   libraries, maintenance, update frequency, stability, security policy, use of
   permissions, etc. I will also provide a few suggestions where applicable
   based on my years of experience as a developer as well as other guidelines
   such as CWE (Common Weakness Enumeration) and OWASP. But they will be far
   from perfect.

and others such as, its potentials or worthiness in the future, or how capable
it is in replacing other well known apps, or how it may not be better than some
less known apps.

My reviews will contain both praise and criticisms. However, the state of open
source development hasn't improved much in the past few years compared to the
amount of new open source apps. So, you should not expect much of a praise from
me, and readers should avoid disturbing the maintainers of the reviewed apps by
asking them to implement everything I suggest in my reviews. You can, of 
course, link my reviews to ask their opinion of my reviews and suggestions, but
not more than that.

I shall review at most two to three apps per month because reviewing an app is
not easy. If a major version of an app is released after its review, I will
write another review instead of amending the existing one to allow archiving.

Finally, as I said above, reviewing is not easy, but I am going to do this
anyway because I want to prove a few points:
1. Open source projects often are not as open as people think they are.
2. Most open source apps do not have any security model, some maintainers do
   not even understand security aspects of their own apps.
3. Most open source developers do not care about privacy either.
4. Many open source projects aren't even open source in first place.
5. Why we need an open source alliance instead of fighting each other.


If you have your favourite app to be reviewed, or if you're a developer
interested in my opinion regarding an app that you built, you can comment on
GitHub or send me an email. I will try to review it if I find it interesting.
(Again, do not expect much praise!)
