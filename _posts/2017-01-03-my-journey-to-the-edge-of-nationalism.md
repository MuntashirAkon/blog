Great was the nature, so great was the river,<br>
So was the mountains—I wish they lay hither!<br>
The journey ended, began from where;<br>
Journey will end, started from where!

We, the mere players of the play,<br>
Have the right to nurture or slay—<br>
It’s our own choice, which to act on.<br>
Clouds were gathering on the horizon,<br>
Upon the mountains of the North-Northwest,<br>
Blazing was the air from the South-Southeast.

I merely looked up, when I saw a light,<br>
Was only a reflection. Unclear was the sight,<br>
Never knew what it was, there wasn’t a guide,<br>
Food was bad, so the people, and so was the ride.<br>
’Twas a battle, and I have lost many a soldier,<br>
In a smily-face, there I was, determined to ignore.

The journey was, as I look through, a fabulous one, indeed,<br>
Learned so much, watched many things, and was pled indeed.<br>
But what I realize seeing the border, at the very first moment,<br>
Nationalism—what it could do. Without further comment,<br>
Keeping everything up to you to decide which to act on.<br>
’Cos clouds were gathering upon the hills on the horizon.
