<a href="https://signal.org/" rel="noreferrer">Signal</a> is considered one of
the ~~best~~ most secure instant messaging apps, because the protocol, namely
Signal protocol, is a very secure protocol. It is also used by its rival,
WhatsApp, which is run by Meta. Although this protocol minimizes the amount of
metadata needed to transfer a message and ensure forward secrecy, it's still
susceptible to the man-in-the-middle attack if you're not careful enough to
verify the *safety number*. But who cares about safety number anyway, or how
this can be done when you have no other way to communicate to the person you're
contacting to actually verify the safety number, or what prevents the client
itself from becoming a man in the middle.

Still, using a secure instant messanger is infinitely better than communicating
via E-Mail. But this is not today's topic. Today's topic is quite simple.

### Background

Signal app on Android offers a privacy feature that allows an user to lock the
app using the PIN/pattern or fingerprints that they have set to lock the phone
itself. This feature can be activated within Signal by navigating to *Settings*
\> *Privacy* \> *App Security* and activating *Lock Signal* option. With this
option activated, the app, once locked, can only be launched by providing the
PIN/pattern or fingerprints that was configured in Android settings.

### The vulnerability

It turns out the above statement is not entirely true. Signal has a
*non-exported* activity called `.PassphraseCreateActivity` which can be used to
easily bypass this restriction. Now, a non-exported activity means that no
apps other than Signal can run this activity without a privileged access such
as root. So, if you have root, you can easily run this activity by running the
following command in any Android terminal:


```shell
su -c am start-activity org.thoughtcrime.securesms/.PassphraseCreateActivity
```

The app, if locked, will be unlocked immediately without asking for any
credentials. As of this writing, this is tested in 6.5.6, the latest version
of Signal received via OTA.

### Is this a critical vulnerability?

**Not at all.** This feature only locks the Signal app itself, database and
preferences are still unencrypted and can be accessible to any entity that
has a privileged access to the operating system. In fact, this vulnerability is
so unimportant that I have reported it to Signal in 19 September 2022 and
haven't received any reply.

### An alternative client

<a href="https://molly.im/" rel="noreferrer">Molly</a>, an independent fork of
Signal, does not have this vulnerability. Rather, its database is protected
with a password, thereby, preventing room for any attacks by an entity with
privileged access to the operating system as long as the password remains
unknown to them. Note that, this is only the Android client, not the server.
So, you will effectively use the Signal servers themselves but on a different
client.


### An alternative platform

<a href="https://simplex.chat" rel="noreferrer">SimpleX</a> has recently <a href="https://simplex.chat/blog/20221108-simplex-chat-v4.2-security-audit-new-website.html" rel="noreferrer">received</a>
an independent audit from <a href="https://www.trailofbits.com/about" rel="noreferrer">Trail of Bits</a>.
Although the audit did not cover the Android client, the library itself is
<a href="https://github.com/trailofbits/publications/blob/master/reviews/SimpleXChat.pdf" rel="noreferrer">reported</a>
to be secure. This protocol does not require any fixed identity such as phone
number or username, therefore, no extra verification step is needed (however,
I do think this to be one of the major drawback since the corporations have, so
far, prevented identity verification to become normalised, and we're used to a
permanent identity such as phone number or username). The app itself, though
having an UI appropriate for iOS rather than Android, is quite *usable*.
