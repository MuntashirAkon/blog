1. I couldn't manage to publish the beta on time due to Eid and my illness (basically the flu you have before the monsoons). v4.0.0-beta02 and v3.1.7 will be released this week.
2. "Contributor of the Month" will be skipped for June since there wasn't any contributor with notable contributions.
3. Google seems to be introducing a lot of breaking changes to the permission APIs in Android 14 as they're figuring out a way to handle virtual devices. Notable changes were introduced in the following revisions: r29 and r50. This may cause frequent crashes as App Manager may not always be up-to-date with the changes.

I hope July will be a productive month as I intend to release v4.0.0 stable by the end of July.
