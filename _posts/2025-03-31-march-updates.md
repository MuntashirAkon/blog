_Eid Mubarak to those who celebrate Eid Al Fitr!_

- Some of you are still sending email related to App Manager in the old email address. Those emails will be ignored, because those messages aren't filtered. Also, please try to add a sane subject line (e.g., App Manager Crash Report, etc.) to your email. Otherwise, they will also not be filtered. I received thousands of emails per month from various sources (not just App Manager). So, unless the subject line looks important, most of them are ignored and deleted after some time. Finally, please use a sane email address as well. If you use lots of `x`s, for example, most spam filters will put it in the Spam folder ;)
- I have been making plans to improve the ADL project (which more-or-less follows UAD-NG project for now). Hopefully, the project will be more reliable in the future with verified and enhanced documentation. Android libraries project, on the other hand, still requires a lot of work on my end which I may be able to finish by this year.
