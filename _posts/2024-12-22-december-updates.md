This is a time when people in many regions become generous and donate to their favorite charities and non-profits. While you cannot donate to App Manager right now, consider donating to the following non-profit organization and services\*. They're part of the reason App Manager is still here: 
1. **IzzyOnDroid.** Contrary to what many people think, IzzyOnDroid is not just a repository, it's a silent movement trying to set some standards on how an open source app should be. Many features in App Manager were possible because of IzzyOnDroid's constant efforts. https://android.izzysoft.de/help?topic=support_us 
2. **F-Droid.** F-Droid is the de facto source of free and open source apps on Android. Many users of App Manager actually install the app from F-Droid. It has many faults, I admit, but it's still the best we've got. https://f-droid.org/en/donate/ 
3. **Exodus Privacy.** It is a community-led effort to maintain a list of trackers in Android applications. App Manager primarily uses this list to report potential trackers in an Android app. https://exodus-privacy.eu.org/en/page/contribute/ 
4. **Bouncy Castle.** App Manager exclusively makes use of the cryptographic libraries maintained by The Legion of Bouncy Castle Inc., an Australian charity and fundraiser. Without their libraries, much of the features of App Manager wouldn't have existed. https://www.bouncycastle.org/engage/donate/ 
5. **Matrix.** Matrix is where our support group is hosted. We've also reused some code related to cryptography from its SDK. https://www.matrix.org/support/ 
6. **Riseup.** App Manager makes use of Riseup's email service for secure communication and GitLab instance for hosting a mirror. https://riseup.net/en/donate 
7. **Codeberg.** App Manager also has a mirror at Codeberg. Codeberg is a non-profit that aims to provide a space to free and open source projects such as App Manager. https://donate.codeberg.org 
8. **Weblate.**\*\* Localization/translations of App Manager are managed through Hosted Weblate, a free service run by Weblate. https://weblate.org/en/donate/ 
9. **UN Crisis Relief Fund.** As M. Gustave put it in _the Grand Budapest Hotel_: “There are still faint glimmers of civilization left in this barbaric slaughterhouse that was once known as humanity.” https://crisisrelief.un.org/opt-crisis 
 
\* I'm not affiliated in any way with any of these services or non-profits nor have they asked me to post this on their behalf. 
\*\* While Weblate software is free and open source, Weblate is NOT a non-profit.
