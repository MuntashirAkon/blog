1. I've _suspended_ GitHub discussions indefinitely as a number of people have been seen abusing this feature in order to bypass the GitHub issue templates.
2. Updates will now be posted in the **App Manager** channel rather than in the **AM Debug** channel to improve the transparency of App Manager project.
3. A _new_ beta will be released near mid-June after updating the documentation.
4. Funding campaign for 2024 was _ended_ on 31 May/1 June (depending on the timezone), and it won't be renewed next year.
5. A “Contributor of the Month” certificate will be issued each month to encourage users to contribute to App Manager and the related projects. It will be issued to a contributor (not to the maintainers) with more impacts than any other contributors (excluding the maintainers). This could be any type of contribution, such as bug fixes, feature improvements, documentation, creating helpful issues, community engagements, and funding. The description of the contribution(s) will be provided in the certificate. A public record will also be kept for verification. The decision will be made heuristically and in good faith. The certificate may not be issued for the month if there isn't any contributor with significant impact or if the contributor has opted out of this program.
6. I'll be starting my Ph.D. in Computer Science at the University of California, Riverside this September! (Shout-out to those who live near Riverside and Los Angeles!) My research will be very close to Android and Linux. So, it won't have a significant impact on the development of App Manager. More information will be available in my blog in due time.
