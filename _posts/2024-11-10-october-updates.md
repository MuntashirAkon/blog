1. I’ve received my Pixel phone which is a bit dull compared to my old phone. It seems as if Google Pixel itself is at least two years behind Lineage OS even though Google is (more or less) the sole maintainer of the AOSP. Weird! Anyway, my phone will be unlocked this month, so I can try better alternatives.
2. I’ve more or less finished writing the documentation. I’m currently merging the translations from Weblate which is a bit tedious task because I need to verify each contribution one by one (and there are 91 such contributions). Most users of App Manager do not speak English. So, this is something where I pay a lot of attention. As I said last year, this task would’ve been easier for me if Weblate had provided a way to moderate the translations on the FOSS tier.
3. The next (and final) beta is scheduled for 12 November if you’re looking for an exact date. I’ve got an extended weekend in the US which I plan to utilize for this purpose.
