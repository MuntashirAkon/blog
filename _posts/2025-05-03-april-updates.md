description: "App Manager update: stable releases appear less tested due to direct repository changes and limited testing capacity; focus remains on improving user experience despite challenging work-life balance; translation requests for documentation require strong, multi-person support to ensure quality."

So, I've started teaching as a Teaching Assistant. It is a new and interesting experience after spending over a decade in software and open source development. Also, in a foreign language that I've never spoken until 2021 when I got my first job abroad. This is yet another bad news for you, however. Because I now need to spend time on preparing for lectures, taking classes, grading along with my regular research and course work. I think many users have already noticed the seemingly "unstable" nature of the stable releases. This is because we now release all the changes made to the repository (well, except a few experimental features) without going through any kind of testing that we used to do. (This, in a way, makes the debug releases more "stable" than the stable release since they may get immediate fixes than the stable which is released last Friday of each month provided there are things to release.) Unfortunately, I cannot do any thing about it right now. My life is currently in a very difficult position where work-life balance does not exist: all work and no life.

A good news, though, is that the small amount of time I can manage for App Manager is largely spent on improving the user experience. This you may have already noticed if you have installed the latest version of App Manager.

Now and then, I receive requests for adding translations for docs in \[placeholder\] language. Please understand that translating docs is a very difficult task, and we do not approve such requests unless the existing translations for the language are very good and are backed by at least two person.
